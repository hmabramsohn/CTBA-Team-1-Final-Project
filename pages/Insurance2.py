# This page will construct a U.S.-based map displaying property insurance loss ratio as a function of zip code.
# Loss ratios will be displayed on a color scale. Loss rations of over >=100%, indicating a financial loss, will be uniform on a separate, striking color.
# The map will be adjustable by year.
# The map may be adjustable between displaying zip codes vs states.
